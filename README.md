# smART

smART is a project made in a group for Hack The North 2021. It is a web application that recommends artwork to users based off previous feedback on other pieces.
The backend is made in Python using Tensorflow to compare similarities between artworks and images. The frontend is made in HTML and Bootstrap CSS with Flask package to integrate. The server was hosted with Google Firebase with Python code run in a Docker container; note that project is not currently online due to server issues, but works locally.
